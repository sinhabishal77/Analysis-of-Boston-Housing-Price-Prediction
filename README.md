# BOSTON HOUSING PRICE PREDICTIONS

## OBJECTIVE
In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

## ABOUT THE DATA
The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.

### Data Set Characteristics

Number of Instances: 506 
      Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical predictive. Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the target.
      Attribute Information (in order):
       - CRIM     per capita crime rate by town
       - ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
       - INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
       - CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
       - NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
       - RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
       - AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
       - DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
       - RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
       - TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
       - PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
       - B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
       - LSTAT    % lower status of the population
       - MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
    
      Missing Attribute Values: None
